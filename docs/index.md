# Last Resort Mask

We are a collective of hackers, makers, and engineers trying to help with the PPE shortage.

**Remember, nothing on this site is medical advice**

## Goals

- We are in an unprecedented worldwide situation and want to help.
- We aim to create last-resort PPE that can be made with common supplies, minimal skills and common tools.
- We are not trying to replace low stocks of certified PPE.

## Supplies You'll Need

- an empty 2-liter bottle
- sticky backed [EVA foam sheets](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Darice-Foamies-Adhesive-Back-Foam-Sheets-Multipack-Assorted-Vibrant-Colors-Great-for-Craft-Projects/24672073?athcpid=24672073&athpgid=athenaItemPage&athcgid=null&athznid=PWVAV&athieid=v0&athstid=CS020&athguid=4e552e63-0ed-1711c8649437bc&athancid=null&athena=true EVA foam sheets) (2-5 mm) (commonly available from craft stores like Michael's, Hobby Lobby or big-box stores such as Walmart)
  - This comes in brand names like Silly Winks
- a balloon (used for the one way exhalation valve)
- a small plastic water bottle (for the filter cartridge)
- hot glue
- twine, string, and/or elastic bands

### Tools

- a pair of scissors or knife
- a marker
- a hot glue gun
- our template
- a drill (optional)
