# Last Resort Mask

We are a collective of hackers, makers, and engineers trying to help with the PPE shortage.

**Remember, nothing on this site is medical advice**

## Goals

- We are in an unprecedented worldwide situation and want to help.
- We aim to create last-resort PPE that can be made with common supplies, minimal skills and common tools.

## Supplies You'll Need

- an empty 2-liter bottle
- sticky backed foam (commonly available from craft stores or big-box stores
- a balloon (used for the one way exhalation valve)
- a small plastic water bottle (for the filter cartridge)
- hot glue
- twine, string, and/or elastic bands

### Tools

- a pair of scissors or knife
- a marker
- a hot glue gun
- our template
- a drill (optional)
